          Developed a comprehensive e-commerce frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on local storage to ensure
          data persistence. This project highlights the importance of user data consistency across sessions, allowing cart items
          to remain intact without relying on a backend database.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user interface is enhanced with Font Awesome icons and showToast notifications, providing
          real-time feedback and creating an engaging shopping experience. The application simulates
          a real-world e-commerce platform by implementing key functionalities, such as adding items to the cart and simulating
          the checkout process to reflect modern online shopping behaviors.
          While the project successfully showcases essential features of an e-commerce store, it currently
          lacks a checkout page, payment options, user profiles, and backend.

          Designed a dynamic and responsive user interface for a men's fashion e-commerce website using HTML, CSS,

          The development process involved crafting custom UI elements that adapt to various screen sizes, maintaining a
          consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. I implemented features tailored to meet customer

          I developed a spending tracker application using Java and MySQL to help users manage their personal finances effectively.
          The user-friendly interface allows individuals to add and categorize expenses, track monthly spending, and view total
          expenditures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can customize expense categories, gain insights into their spending habits, and tailor the application to their needs
          by adding or deleting categories. With a focus on usability and efficiency, this application serves as an essential tool for
          anyone looking to take control of their finances and make informed decisions about their spending.
