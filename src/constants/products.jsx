          Clan-Chat is a Discord-like application inspired by a YouTube tutorial on
          creating a Discord clone using Next.js.
          Initially, the tutorial utilized Socket.IO and LiveKit
          for core functionalities. However, I decided to challenge myself by
          implementing WebSockets and WebRTC to manage real-time communication and live calls.
        
        </p>
        <p>
          Key aspects of the project include:


          Real-Time Communication: Implemented using WebSockets for chat functionality.
          Live Calls: Exploring WebRTC to handle video and voice communication.
          System Architecture: Designing a multi-server setup to manage different aspects of the application:
          WebRTC Server: For handling live calls.
          WebSockets Server: For managing real-time chat.
          Next.js Application: Handling authentication and user flow.
